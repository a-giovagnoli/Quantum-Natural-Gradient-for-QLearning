# Quantum Natural Gradient
Here I report a documented work in progress to apply the Quantum Natural Gradient to the case of Deep Reinforcement Learning. Strating from the existing examples and literature, I tried to apply it to the Q-Learning algorithm, which doesn't show promising results with the classical update rule instead.
