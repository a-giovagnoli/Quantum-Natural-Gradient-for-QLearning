# Quantum Natural Gradient
Here I report a documented work in progress of a personal project: trying to apply the Quantum Natural Gradient to the case of Deep Reinforcement Learning. 

Strating from the existing examples and literature, I'm trying to study it and adapt it to the Q-Learning algorithm, since Quantum Deep Q Learning doesn't show promising results with the classical update rule.
